## Inspiration
___
A few months ago at Hack the North, Vinod Khosla (the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems) was giving the opening talk. He was asked the question "what do you think is the next big thing?"

His answer was simple, "A.I."

He predicted that A.I will eventually spread to fields like business, then to education, then to healthcare, but eventually, _A.I will be a predominant element politics_, __which is huge.__

We built this project with the idea that A.I could be a tool that a president uses to help make informed decisions
